# TrueFork
By Stephanie Anshell and Ved Panse

## Introduction
**Project goal**: Analyze Food.com recipes to see if healthy dishes are rated differently than indulgent ones, then build a prediction model for recipe ratings.

**Data source**: mention RAW_recipes.csv and RAW_interactions.csv (recipes since 2008).

**Null hypothesis**: There is no difference in mean ratings between healthy and unhealthy recipes.


## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Merge recipes & interactions** on `id = recipe_id`  
- **Convert** 0 â†’ `NaN`, compute `mean_rating`  
- **Parse** `nutrition` into numeric columns  
- **Example table** (via `.to_markdown()`)  
- **Interactive plot**:
